[Project 1: Weekly reporting facilitated through the integration of Microsoft Planner and Power BI]

**Problem statement** - Weekly reporting from team members to line managers relied on Microsoft Word templates, leading to manual consolidation efforts for divisional managers. This process lacked efficient project status tracking and consistency in reporting formats across teams. Moreover, limited visibility into ongoing projects hindered opportunities for cross-collaboration.

**Automation process** - We have implemented an efficient reporting system using Microsoft Planner, organizing tasks into buckets for easy categorization. Team members now input their weekly tasks, along with relevant details and timelines, to track progress effectively. The resulting reports, generated through Planner templates, seamlessly integrate with Power BI for streamlined consolidation. This allows management to gain a comprehensive, real-time view of team projects and status updates, with the flexibility to explore details at any level of interest. The automation of data transfer from Microsoft Planner to Power BI is facilitated through Microsoft Power Automate.

**Benefits to the teams** -  This approach has enabled our team to adopt a structured, consistent, and transparent reporting method. Through automation, accessing project progress reports is now effortless and immediate. Furthermore, consolidation can be tailored at various levels and filtered as needed by users in Power BI, offering personalized insights for a diverse audience.
